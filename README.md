# Exploratory Data Analysis

**By**: Ensun Pak, Stephen Louie and Abhradeep Mukherjee

This repository contains our group presentation for our MSDS 610: Communication for Analytics course, where we are presenting our views on the importance of EDA.

## Objective 
The objective of this presentation is to show the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis with a real life scenario. Along the way we'll realize how important EDA is and why Data Scientitsts should spend a good amount of time in EDA.  

## Importance of EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis helps us to –
· To give insight into a data set.
· Understand the underlying structure.
· Extract important parameters and relationships that hold between them.
· Test underlying assumption

The figure below shows the process flow from data collection to decision making which is generally done in any data oriented work

## Type of EDA

Generally, EDA falls into two categories:
- **univariate analysis** involves analyzing one feature, such as summarizing and finding the feature patterns.
- **multivariate analysis** technique shows the relationship between two or more features using cross-tabulation or statistic

## Important Definitions

Before we delve into the intricacies of EDA there are a few things that we should be aware of. This document will give you enough information to get your hands dirty with data.
